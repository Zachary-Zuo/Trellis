# Implementation Plan: Path-scoped on-demand spec injection

Baseline note: with the marketplace submodule initialized and `LC_ALL=C LANG=C`,
the full suite is green on main (1552 tests). Pre-commit runs the full suite —
commit with that env.

## Stage A — Matching engine (templates)

- [x] A1. New `packages/cli/src/templates/trellis/scripts/common/spec_match.py`:
      frontmatter head-parser + glob→regex translation + `match_specs_for_file`
      per design.md §1–2. Unit-testable pure functions.
- [x] A2. `get_context.py --mode spec --file <path>` wired through
      `common/git_context.py` dispatch per design.md §5.

Validation: `pnpm lint:py` (packages/cli); direct interpreter checks of glob
translation edge cases (`*` vs `**`, `?`, trailing `/`, invalid globs).

## Stage B — Injection hook (templates)

- [x] B1. New `packages/cli/src/templates/shared-hooks/inject-spec-context.py`
      per design.md §3–4: stdin parse, kill switches, config gate, match,
      session dedup (+mtime re-arm, 48 h prune), budget assembly
      (8192/9000 defaults, UTF-8-safe truncation, overflow → `<spec-index>`
      lines), `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` emit, top-level
      try/except → exit 0.
- [x] B2. `templates/claude/settings.json`: PostToolUse entries (Edit, Write,
      MultiEdit) → the new hook, timeout 15.
- [x] B3. `templates/shared-hooks/index.ts` SHARED_HOOKS_BY_PLATFORM: add the
      script for claude only (comment the follow-up posture).
- [x] B4. `templates/trellis/config.yaml`: commented `spec_injection:` section
      (enabled / max_spec_bytes / max_total_bytes) following the
      `context_injection:` section's comment style.

Validation: fixture-driven stdin runs — match/no-match/dedup/mtime-rearm/
truncation/malformed-frontmatter/disabled-config; assert exit 0 + valid JSON
or empty output in every case.

## Stage C — Tests

- [x] C1. Python-behavior tests in the existing vitest python-harness style
      (see how regression.test.ts drives task.py/hooks): spec_match glob
      semantics, hook E2E matrix from B validation, pull mode output.
- [x] C2. Template-shape tests: settings.json gains PostToolUse block
      (wherever claude settings template is asserted, e.g. platforms/templates
      tests); SHARED_HOOKS registry test if one exists for hook distribution.

## Stage D — Dogfood

- [x] D1. Frontmatter on `.trellis/spec/cli/backend/*.md` translating the
      index.md Pre-Development Checklist mapping (no invented mappings).
- [x] D2. Live mirrors: `.claude/settings.json` PostToolUse block,
      `.claude/hooks/inject-spec-context.py`,
      `.trellis/scripts/common/spec_match.py`, live get_context dispatch
      (surgical patches; live copies carry drift).

Validation: edit a scratch file matching a dogfood glob via fabricated
PostToolUse stdin against this repo; confirm injection then dedup.

## Stage E — Spec docs

- [x] E1. New `.trellis/spec/cli/backend/spec-injection.md` (frontmatter
      contract, matching, budget, dedup, platform matrix incl. degradations).
- [x] E2. `.trellis/spec/cli/backend/index.md`: Guidelines Index row +
      Pre-Development Checklist row for the new spec.

## Stage F — Full gate

- [x] F1. `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && (packages/cli) pnpm lint:py` clean;
      `LC_ALL=C LANG=C pnpm test` fully green.
- [x] F2. trellis-check quality pass over the diff.

## Rollback points

Hook + registration are additive; reverting the PR restores prior behavior.
Frontmatter left behind is inert (verify §Rollback claim in design.md during
implementation: grep spec consumers for leading-`---` sensitivity).

# Implement v2 (ticket-refresh upgrade)

- [x] V1. Rewrite decision engine + identity ladder + global JSONL state + GC in
      `packages/cli/src/templates/shared-hooks/inject-spec-context.py`; add Read
      matcher to `templates/claude/settings.json`; add refresh_window_* keys to
      `templates/trellis/config.yaml` (per design.md v2 — formats are frozen).
- [x] V2. Tests: rework `test/scripts/spec-injection.integration.test.ts` to the
      v2 state machine (PRD v2 acceptance list, incl. agent_id separation,
      TRELLIS_SPEC_STATE_DIR hermeticity, Read trigger, GC prune);
      `test/templates/claude.test.ts` Read matcher assertions.
- [x] V3. Mirrors + docs: live `.claude/hooks/inject-spec-context.py`,
      `.claude/settings.json`, live `.trellis/config.yaml` comment block;
      `spec-injection.md` contract doc v2 rewrite (ticket model, ladder, state,
      windows); config comment style consistent.
- [ ] V4. Full gate (lint/typecheck/lint:py/full suite LC_ALL=C) + trellis-check
      + commit + push (updates draft PR #468) + PR body refresh.

# Stage R — review revision (2026-07-25)

taosu's PR #468 review, frozen in design.md "Review revision (2026-07-25)".
Implemented exactly as written; contract-inherent gaps found during validation
were reported for a contract decision, not improvised away.

- [x] R1. Budgets in characters: `max_spec_chars` 9400 / `max_total_chars`
      9500; hard ceiling enforced on the assembled payload string (wrappers,
      `\n\n` separators, `<spec-index>` block, `(+N more)` summary, tickets
      all counted); code-point truncation — byte-level truncate_utf8 removed
      from this hook.
- [x] R2. Clock = real user turns (`type=="user"` + string `message.content` +
      no `isMeta`), `refresh_window_lines` → `refresh_window_turns` (30);
      `compact_boundary` count rule in decide() before the window check;
      negative delta demoted to a plain clock-anomaly guard (no /compact
      claim); single-pass scan with byte prefilters, 64 MiB cap → wall clock.
- [x] R3. Subagent clock reads the subagent's own derived transcript
      (`<dir>/<parent stem>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`); absent → wall
      clock, never the parent's counts; `+a-<agent_id>` identity split
      unchanged.
- [x] R4. State: one `<identity>.jsonl` per identity (no pid shards); `v:2`
      records with turns+boundaries, `v != 2` ignored; best-effort
      fcntl.flock held across read→decide→append.
- [x] R5. Fail-closed: open-for-append doubles as the writability probe →
      stateless ticket-only circuit breaker; GC exact-depth
      `<base>/<16-hex>/<name>.jsonl` with the frozen name pattern, hourly
      `.last-gc` gate, 48 h age, no rglob.
- [x] R6. Robustness: validate_glob whitelist → deny-list; stateless ticket
      wording (no prior-exposure claim); frontmatter tolerance (block
      scalars, stray list items, unknown line shapes); Windows stdin
      reconfigured alongside stdout; settings.json single PostToolUse entry
      with matcher "Read|Edit|Write|MultiEdit" + `spec_injection.tools`
      config filter.
- [x] R7. Pure logic extracted to `common/spec_inject.py` (template + live
      twin, registered in templates/trellis/index.ts); hook reduced to IO
      shell; read+hash-before-decide kept (accepted trade-off, recorded in
      design.md).
- [x] R8. truncate_utf8 boundary fix back-ported to
      inject-subagent-context.py (template + .claude/.cursor live twins) and
      the TS mirror truncateUtf8 in pi/extensions/trellis/index.ts.txt;
      taosu's exact repros added as regression tests in
      context-injection-limits.integration.test.ts (24/24 green, 3 new).
- [x] R-docs. `.trellis/spec/cli/backend/spec-injection.md` fully synced to
      R1-R7 (byte budgets, line clock, pid shards, negative-delta-as-/compact,
      glob whitelist and four-matcher registration removed);
      script-conventions.md grepped for spec-hook budget references — none,
      left untouched.

Validation commands used:

- `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck` (repo root) — clean
- `cd packages/cli && pnpm lint:py` — 0 errors, warning count = HEAD baseline
- `python3 -m py_compile` on every changed hook/module — OK
- Hermetic smoke matrix against the frozen contract via fabricated
  PostToolUse stdin + `TRELLIS_SPEC_STATE_DIR` — 26/26 green
- `LC_ALL=C LANG=C pnpm vitest run
  test/scripts/context-injection-limits.integration.test.ts` (R8) — 24/24
- Template/live mirror byte-equality checks after every twin patch

Open items carried to V4: rework the 11 pre-review test assertions in
spec-injection.integration.test.ts + claude.test.ts to the R-contract; contract
decisions on the three reported gaps (9400/9500 makes the truncation path
unreachable; the GC name pattern cannot match `+a-` subagent shards; the
`(+N more)` summary is nearly unreachable under the greedy index packer).

# Stage AF — audit fixes (2026-07-25 frozen contract F1-F20)

The 32-confirmed / 5-partial adversarial audit, fixed verbatim per design.md
"Audit fix round (2026-07-25) — frozen contract F1-F20". Contract defects and
scope gaps were reported on each stage's dispatch, never improvised away.

- [x] AF-F1. Subagent clock beats: `scan_transcript` returns
      `{turns, assistant_turns, boundaries}` (counts decided on the parsed
      record; prefilter is only a necessary condition); new `select_beats`
      picks assistant beats when `agent_id` is present. Real-case bar: 58/58
      real subagent transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/**/subagents/` have
      exactly 1 user turn (assistant beats 2..244).
- [x] AF-F2. Collision-free `_sanitize`: 80-char filesystem-safe head +
      `-` + `sha256(raw)[:8]` whenever any char was replaced or length
      exceeded 80; `+a-<agent_id>` appended after per-part sanitization.
- [x] AF-F3. One normalization: exported canonical `normalize_repo_relative`
      (resolve `strict=False` on root+file, NFC, `re.IGNORECASE` globs on
      darwin/win32); hook `_repo_rel` deleted.
- [x] AF-F4. Frontmatter: flow sequences (`paths: [a, b]`), head bound raised
      to 16 KiB / 200 lines, unterminated block => warn + skip, opening `---`
      with no recognized key => not-frontmatter (silent).
- [x] AF-F5. Config honesty: `tools` block/flow/`[]` grammar with early exit
      + unknown-name stderr warn; `max_spec_chars: 0` = unlimited derive
      ceiling (`len(text)`); `MAX_SPEC_SOURCE_BYTES` 10 MiB degrade to index
      line with warn.
- [x] AF-F6. Named-index reserve from true index-line strings capped at 900
      chars (summary-only fallback); `"complete": false` records for
      truncated FULLs; incomplete past-window re-taught as FULL, never a
      lying ticket; fits/fits_reserved merged into one closure.
- [x] AF-F7. GC containment: symlinked project dirs/shards skipped;
      realpath(shard) must stay under realpath(base); name/depth gates kept.
- [x] AF-F8. `scan_transcript` catches `Exception` -> None (wall-clock
      degrade); a hostile transcript line can no longer abort the event.
- [x] AF-F9. camelCase `toolInput` fallback; Windows stream reconfigure
      covers stderr (six-hook parity).
- [x] AF-F10. `_unquote`/`_strip_inline_comment` imported from
      `.trellis_config`; `SpecCandidate` Protocol deleted (SpecMatch
      imported); `load_state` equal-ts tie-break newest-wins (`>=`).
- [x] AF-F11. Truthful docs & wording: `_derive_fitting_full` docstring
      (binary search) + hook module docstring (delegation-era identity, no
      T1/T2/T4 remnants) rewritten; falsified budget-constants comment fixed
      (wrapper arithmetic); spec-injection.md synced (both beat definitions,
      hash-suffix sanitization, named-index reserve + softened §5 claim,
      complete-flag re-teach, GC symlink rule, 16 KiB/200 bounds, tools
      grammar incl `[]` + unknown-name warn, corrected 9400/9500 arithmetic
      — 69-char fixed wrapper + rel paths, ~9,348 lands whole — pid-merge
      vocabulary purged, live-config code-map claim fixed, dynamic-plural
      runnable summary wording, 10 MiB source bound, canonical-normalization
      §3 contract); index.md Guidelines row rewritten (ticket-refresh,
      character budgets) + checklist row gains `common/spec_inject.py`;
      accepted-items notes recorded (local numeric coercion, user-global
      state layout, mixed-comparability compaction gap + healing).
      NOTE: the summary-line wording change inside `common/spec_inject.py`
      and its frozen-wording tests are the remaining code half of this bullet
      — they must land in lockstep (the docs stage recorded the contract
      wording; code still emits the pre-F11 string).
- [x] AF-F12. Pi TS coverage: `pi-truncate-utf8.integration.test.ts`
      transpiles `truncateUtf8` out of `pi/extensions/trellis/index.ts.txt`
      (typescript devDep, node:vm), taosu's repros + 0..30 cap sweep;
      reverting the R8 fix turns the suite red (verified, then restored).
- [ ] AF-F13. Five §12-required tests — landing in a parallel test stage
      (spec-injection.integration.test.ts rework observed in-flight at
      docs-stage time, incl. the three assertions F1/F4/F6 reverse by
      contract); flip this box with that stage's own gate log, together with
      the AF-F11 frozen-wording test updates.
- [x] AF-F14. Discussion #474 specificity ordering: exact paths and narrower
      matching globs now precede broad tree globs; `rel_path` is only the final
      tie-break, with one regression test that reverses alphabetical order.

Verification commands used across the stages:

- `cd packages/cli && pnpm lint:py` — 0 errors (warnings = HEAD baseline)
- `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck` (repo root) — clean
- `python3 -m py_compile` on every changed hook/module — OK
- `LC_ALL=C LANG=C pnpm vitest run test/scripts/` — pi suite 3/3 green; three
  pre-existing spec-injection assertions fail BY CONTRACT (F1 subagent beats,
  F4 unclosed-frontmatter warn+skip, F6 named-index reserve) pending AF-F13
- Real-case bar: 58/58 real subagent transcripts scanned (1 user turn each);
  real compacted transcript (grep compact_boundary) re-scanned; every audit
  repro re-run before (git HEAD) vs after per finding
- Mirrors: `diff -q` template vs live twin after every edit — byte-identical

# Stage OC — OpenCode dynamic spec loading (2026-07-29)

- [x] OC1. Verify the OpenCode 1.17.18 stable plugin contract and real runtime:
      pre-tool hooks expose `write` / `edit` `filePath` and full
      `apply_patch.patchText`; thrown errors prevent mutation, remain
      model-visible, and continue the model loop.
- [x] OC2. Add `inject-spec-context.js` as a thin adapter over the shared
      Python engine, including `session.compacted` reset handling and
      fail-open subprocess/JSON parsing.
- [x] OC3. Distribute `inject-spec-context.py` through
      `SHARED_HOOKS_BY_PLATFORM.opencode` and the shared OpenCode init/update
      collector.
- [x] OC4. Add automated coverage for write block/retry/compact, native
      multi-file `apply_patch` forwarding, generic PreToolUse deny-once, and
      generated file presence.
- [x] OC5. Update the executable spec and beta EN/ZH documentation.
- [x] OC6. Run focused/full gates, build the CLI, install into an isolated
      project, and repeat the real OpenCode write-and-retry probe. The full
      suite passed (CLI 1711; core 333 with 1 skipped), as did lint, typecheck,
      build, and docs lint. OpenCode blocked `WRONG`, returned the governing
      spec to the model, and accepted the corrected retry.
